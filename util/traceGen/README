Files in this directory are used to generate trace files for Manifold using QSim server.

To generate trace files, follow the steps below:

1. Go to models/processor/zesto, make a backup copy of qsimclient-core.cc and qsimclient-core.h.
Then copy the two files in this directory to zesto.

2. Open qsimclient-core.cc. At the beginning of the file, modify the definition
of FILENAME to the name you want for your trace files.

3. Compile Zesto.

4. Build the simulator under simulator/smp/QSimClient.

5. Modify the simulator's configure file (mainly the nubmer of cycles) according to your needs.

6. Start QSim server.

7. Start the simulator.


If you didn't do Step 2, and find the file names are not what you want, you can
use the script rename.sh to rename the trace files.
