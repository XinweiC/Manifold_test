==========

This directory contains a program, itrace.cpp, that is used to produce trace
files for Zesto.

To use it,

1. Copy the directory to <PIN>/source/tools,
where <PIN> is the installation directory of PIN.

2. cd <PIN>/source/tools/itrace
make

This produces a directory obj-ia32, and in that directory a file itrace.so.

3. To generate trace file for a binary:

../../../pin -t obj-ia32/itrace.so -- <binary>

where <binary> is the path to the 32-bit binary of your application.

4. A file itrace_0.out is producted. This file can be used with Zesto.


### NOTES ###

1. This has been tested with PIN 2.12.
2. There is a variable "start" that tells the program to skip that many instructions at
the beginning. I've set it to 0, so nothing is skipped.
3. The macro MAX_INSTRUCTIONS defines the max number of instructions to process.
