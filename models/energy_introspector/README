1. Build Library Models:

    1.1 Build IntSim (if used):
        # Test the original copy of IntSim.
            $ cd ENERGYLIB_INTSIM/intsim_alpha
            $ make
            $ ./intsim
        # If IntSim runs successfully, it creates an output file intsim.out
        # Go back to the Energy Introspector main directory to create IntSim archive.
            $ make intsim

    1.2 Build McPAT (if used):
        # Download McPAT0.8 (http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/mcpat/) to ENERGYLIB_MCPAT/
        # After extracting tarball, there must be ENERGYLIB_MCPAT/mcpat0.8_r274
        # Test the original copy of McPAT.
            $ cd ENERGYLIB_MCPAT/mcpat0.8_r274
            $ make
            $ ./mcpat -print_level 5 -opt_for_clk 1 -infile Xeon.xml
        # If McPAT runs successfully, it prints out the results.
        # Go back to the Energy Introspector main directory to create McPAT archive.
            $ make mcpat

    1.3 Build TSV (if used):
        # At the Energy Introspector main directory,
        $ make tsv;

    1.4 Build HotSpot (if used):
        # Download HotSpot5.02 (http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/HotSpot/index.htm)
        # to THERMALLIB_HOTSPOT/
        # After extracting tarball, there must be THERMALLIB_HOTSPOT/HotSpot-5.02
        # Test the original copy of HotSpot.
            $ cd THERMALLIB_HOTSPOT/HotSpot-5.02
            $ make
            $ ./hotspot -f ev6.flp -p gcc.ptrace -model_type grid -grid_layer_file layer.lcf
        # If HotSpot runs successfully, it prints steady-state temperatures of 
        # floorplan units.
        # Go back to the Energy Introspector main directory to create HotSpot archive.
            $ make hotspot

    1.5 Build 3D-ICE (if used):
        # Download SuperLU-4.3 (http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/) to THERMALLIB_3DICE/
        # After extracting tarball, there must be THERMALLIB_3DICE/SuperLU_4.3
        # Donwload 3D-ICE 2.1 (http://esl.epfl.ch/3d-ice.html) to THERMALLIB_3DICE/
        # After extracting tarball, there must be THERMALLIB_3DICE/3d-ice
        # Test the original copy of 3D-ICE.
            $ cd THERMALLIB_3DICE/SuperLU_4.3
            $ make blaslib
            $ make superlulib
            $ cd ../3d-ice/ # go to THERMALLIB_3DICE/3d-ice
            $ make
            $ ./3D-ICE-Emulator example_transient.stk
        # If 3D-ICE runs successfully, it prints transient temperatures and creates several output*.txt files.
        # Go back to the Energy Introspector main directory to create 3d-ice archive.
        $ make 3dice;

    NOTE: In each library model, there is a tarball directory which includes a
          downloaded copy from the original developers' website. In case that there 
          is a problem with downloading the specified version of model, the included
          tarball may be used to build it, but we do not guarantee this is the same 
          copy as the original developers' release nor possess any copyrights or \
          responsibilities of using it. All terms and conditions are subject to what 
          the original developers present.


2. Test Energy Introspector:
        # Test examples are available at TEST_MAIN/test-$(LIBRARY_NAME).cc
        # The examples load input configuration file froms CONFIG/$(LIBRARY_NAME)/
        # The executions are equivalent to test commands in the section 1.1 above.
        # NOTE: The results may differ from those of the test commands in the section 1.1
        #       for various reasons depending on the library models:
        #           1. IntSim:  IntSim v1.0 was updated with configurable parameters
        #                       based on the technology node, which slightly differ from
        #                       fixed default values provided in the original IntSim.
        #           2. McPAT:   McPAT v0.8 includes several (apparent) bugs and errors.
        #                       Patch files are provided in ENERGYLIB_MCPAT/patch/ to fix
        #                       those and thus produce different outputs.
        #           3. HotSpot: Patch files of HotSpot v5.02 in THERMALLIB_HOTSPOT/patch/
        #                       are only to fix build and link errors when creating
        #                       an archive file.
        #           4. 3D-ICE:  Patch files of 3D-ICE v2.1 in THERMALLIB_3DICE/patch/
        #                       are only to fix build and link errors when creating
        #                       an archive file.
        # Make test files.
            $ make test
        # If any of included library models were built, it creates test-$(LIBRARY_NAME)
        # executables in the main Energy Introspector directory.
